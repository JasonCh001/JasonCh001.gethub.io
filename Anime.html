                Mobile Suit Gundam was developed by animator Yoshiyuki
                Tomino and a changing group of Sunrise creators with the
                collective pseudonym of Hajime Yatate. The series was
                originally entitled Freedom Fighter Gunboy (or Gunboy) for
                the robot's gun, with teen boys the primary target
                demographic. Early production had a number of references to
                freedom: the White Base was originally "Freedom's Fortress",
                the Core Fighter was the "Freedom Wing" and the Gunperry was
                the "Freedom Cruiser". The Yatate team combined the English
                word "gun" with the last syllable of the word "freedom" to
                form the portmanteau Gundom. Tomino changed it to Gundam,
                suggesting a unit wielding a gun powerful enough to hold
                back enemies like a hydroelectric dam holding back water. In
                keeping with the concept, Gundams are depicted as prototypes
                or limited-production, with higher capabilities than
                mass-produced units.

                    <b>Mobile Suit Gundam</b> TV series the plot is Set in a
                    fictional universe (Universal Century year 0079
                    according to the Gundam Calendar), the Principality of
                    Zeon has declared independence from the Earth
                    Federation, and subsequently launched a war of
                    independence called the One Year War. The conflict has
                    directly affected every continent on Earth, also nearly
                    every space colony and lunar settlement. Zeon, though
                    smaller, has the tactical upper hand through their use
                    of a new type of humanoid weapons called mobile suits.
                    After half of all humanity perishes in the conflict, the
                    war settled into a bitter stalemate lasting over 8
                    month.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The story begins with a newly deployed Federation
                    warship, the White Base, arriving at the secret research
                    base located at the Side 7 colony to pick up the
                    Federation's newest weapon. However, they are closely
                    followed by Zeon forces. A Zeon reconnaissance team
                    member disobeys mission orders and attacks the colony,
                    killing most of the Federation crew and civilians in the
                    process. Out of desperation, young Amuro Ray
                    accidentally finds the Federation's new prototype
                    arsenal—the RX-78 Gundam, and manages to beat back Zeon
                    forces. Scrambling everything they can, the White Base
                    sets out with her newly formed crew of civilian recruits
                    and refugees in her journey to survive
                </p>

                <p>
                    On their journey, the White Base members often encounter
                    the Zeon Lieutenant Commander Char Aznable. Although
                    Char antagonizes Amuro in battle, he takes advantage of
                    their position as Federation members to have them kill
                    members from Zeon's Zabi family as part of his revenge
                    scheme. Amuro also meets ensign Lalah Sune with whom he
                    falls in love, but accidentally kills when facing Char.
                    When the Federation Forces invade the Fortress of A Baoa
                    Qu to defeat the Zeon forces, Amuro engages on a final
                    one-on-one duel against Char due to both blaming the
                    other for Lalah's death. Having realized he forgot his
                    true enemy, Char stops fighting to kill the last
                    surviving Zabi member, Kycilia Zabi. Amuro then reunites
                    with his comrades as the war reaches its end.

                    year Universal Century (UC) 0087, eight years after the
                    events of Mobile Suit Gundam (0079), and four years

                    Memory (0083 to 0084) the series follows a rebel group
                    called the Anti-Earth Union Group (AEUG) as they try to
                    defeat the Titans, an elite task force of the Earth
                    Federation designed to hunt down Zeon remnants but which
                    ruthlessly kills anyone demanding equal rights for the
                    space citizens in cold blood.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The story of Zeta Gundam is told through the viewpoint
                    of Kamille Bidan, a civilian teenager and amateur mobile
                    suit pilot whose parents are engineers working for the
                    Earth Federation and the Titans. While traveling to the
                    Green Noa colony to meet his parents, Kamille is
                    insulted by and strikes a Titans officer named Jerid
                    Messa. Following an AEUG attack led by Quattro Bajeena
                    on the colony to capture a trio of Gundam Mk-II mobile
                    suits undergoing field tests, Kamille takes the
                    opportunity to steal Messa's Mk-II to repel the attack
                    and follows Quattro back to the AEUG mothership Argama.
                    The Titans, under the order of Bask Om, take Kamille's
                    parents in an attempt to force the return of the stolen
                    Gundam Mk-II's. Jerid, unaware of the hostage plot,
                    mistakenly kills Kamille's mother. Because of this, and
                    many other reasons, Kamille eventually joins the AEUG.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As the war escalates, Kamille encounters people from all
                    sides of the conflict, including brainwashed Titans,
                    artificial Newtypes and the leaders of Anaheim
                    Electronics, who are secretly funding the AEUG. The AEUG
                    eventually launch a full-scale attack on the Earth
                    Federation's assembly at Dakar, leading to an Earth
                    Sphere civil war. Quattro reveals himself to be Char
                    Aznable and presents evidence of the Titans' tyranny
                    including using G3 nerve gas on a defenseless colony.
                    The Earth Federation court soon rules the Titans'
                    actions to be illegal and backs the AEUG in hunting down
                    Titans leader Jamitov Hymem.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After losing the support of the Earth Federation, the
                    Titans turn to their original enemy, remnants of the
                    Principality of Zeon now known as Axis Zeon, to form an
                    alliance to regain control of the Earth Sphere. Axis
                    Zeon's leader Haman Karn contacts the AEUG, using the
                    civil war of the Earth Federation at hand to politically
                    ask for the control of Side 3, the former Zeon colony.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Axis involvement and Jamitov's assassination by Jupiter
                    Fleet commander Paptimus Scirocco soon leads to a battle
                    over the colony headquarters of the Titans, Gryps, which
                    has been modified to be a colony laser. The war ends
                    when Kamille, piloting the titular mobile suit Z Gundam,
                    kills Scirocco in battle and the AEUG sinks Scirocco's
                    flagship and most of the Titans' fleet. However, Kamille
                    himself is psychologically broken and although survives
                    without any physical harm to him or the Zeta Gundam,
                    becomes mentally unstable with signs of memory lapse
                    and/or insanity.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The series concludes with both the AEUG and Earth
                    Federation, after suffering considerable losses over the
                    course of the war, facing the full force of Axis Zeon,

                    Out of the major Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam characters,
                    Captain Bright Noa and Axis leader Haman Karn are
                    featured prominently in Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ; Hayato

                    Gable, Mineva Lao Zabi, and the children Shinta and Qum
                    are featured in various episodes as well; Sayla Mass,
                    who had appeared in the first series but had no speaking
                    role in Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam, also appeared in
                    several episodes of Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ; Char
                    Aznable's planned appearance was canceled when Tomino
                    was given the go-ahead to do the Mobile Suit Gundam:
                    Char's Counterattack film. Yoshiyuki Tomino's original
                    plan for the show which involved Char's return was never
                    revealed, nor does Tomino himself remember it. Also,
                    aside from the openings and story recap/preview episode,
                    Amuro Ray does not make an appearance in the series
                    either.

                    the plotIn UC 0093, Char Aznable has returned to lead
                    Neo Zeon. As the film opens, Char's forces have arranged
                    to drop the asteroid Fifth Luna on the Earth. Special
                    task force Londo Bell, whose members include veteran
                    soldiers Amuro Ray and Bright Noa, attempt to prevent
                    the catastrophe. Char is successful and the asteroid
                    crashes into Lhasa, Tibet.

                <p>
                    Earth Federation Prime Minister Adenaur Paraya and his
                    teenage daughter Quess narrowly escape the crashing
                    asteroid. Their space shuttle meets with Londo Bell's
                    command ship, the Ra Cailum, which has just finished
                    collecting Amuro's new mobile suit, the RX-93 Nu Gundam,
                    and Amuro's close friend Chan Agi. The Nu Gundam is
                    equipped with new “psycho-frame” technology, which
                    amplifies Newtype abilities. Bright is reunited with his
                    young son Hathaway, who was also on the escaping
                    shuttle. Adenaur instructs Bright to deliver him to the
                    colony Londenion for some important business. While on
                    board, Quess becomes smitten with Amuro, and Hathaway
                    develops a crush on Quess.
                </p>

                <p>
                    On the Londenion colony, Adenaur's business is revealed
                    to be a secret meeting with Char and other Neo Zeon
                    leaders to arrange a treaty; the Neo Zeon will gain the
                    asteroid Axis in exchange for disarming their fleet.
                    While relaxing on the colony with Quess and Hathaway,
                    Amuro recognizes Char and confronts him. Overhearing the
                    two men argue, Quess becomes enamored of Char's
                    philosophies and leaves the colony with him, much to
                    Hathaway's distress.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Quess turns out to be a Newtype and a naturally talented
                    mobile suit pilot. Char takes advantage of her unstable
                    nature and manipulates her feelings to use her as a
                    weapon against Amuro. Char reveals that the treaty with
                    the Federation is a ruse. The Neo Zeon forces ambush the
                    Federation fleet at the supposed disarmament, and Axis
                    is sent on a collision course with the Earth. Londo Bell
                    attempts to stop the asteroid using Axis’ stockpile of
                    nuclear weapons, but only succeeds in splitting the
                    asteroid into two pieces.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A furious battle between Londo Bell, the Federation, and
                    Neo Zeon erupts. Quess descends into madness and
                    violence while piloting the psycho-frame-equipped mobile
                    armor Alpha Azieru. Hathaway steals a mobile suit and
                    futilely tries to convince Quess to stop fighting and
                    come with him. Chan kills Quess to protect Hathaway from
                    the girl's insane attacks but is herself killed by
                    Hathaway in a rage over Quess's death. Amuro and Char
                    duel in their psycho-frame mobile suits, the Nu Gundam
                    and MSN-04 Sazabi, and Amuro defeats his long-time
                    rival. With Char's escape pod in tow, Amuro desperately
                    attempts to push back the descending Axis asteroid,
                    aided by Federation and Zeon suits alike. The power of
                    the Nu Gundam's psycho-frame amplifies Amuro's Newtype
                    abilities to an unbelievable level. Amuro, Char, and the
                    Nu Gundam vanish in a massive flare of light as both
                    halves of Axis are pushed away from the Earth.

                    Episiodes is a side story to the main Gundam franchise
                    continuity.The Gundam series is set in a fictional
                    calendar era known as "Universal Century" and it
                    establishes that there is a so-called "One Year War"
                    between the Earth Federation and Principality of
                    Zeon—the setting for the original series—, and War in
                    the Pocket is set in the last days of the war.

                <p>
                    In Universal Century 0079, Zeon intelligence has
                    identified a prototype Federation Gundam under
                    development in a Federation base in the Arctic. Elite
                    Zeon MS commandos are dispatched to destroy the
                    prototype, but before they can accomplish their mission
                    the Gundam is launched into space. When the Gundam turns
                    up in a Federation R&D base inside the neutral space
                    colony Side 6, the Principality launches a covert
                    operation to destroy the Gundam utilizing the commando
                    team originally dispatched to assault the Arctic base,
                    including young rookie Bernard "Bernie" Wiseman.
                    However, the raid fails and the entire team is killed
                    except for Bernie.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After crashing his mobile suit, Bernie manages to
                    befriend Alfred "Al" Izuruha, an elementary school boy
                    enamored with a romantic vision of warfare and excited
                    by Bernie's status as a mobile suit pilot regardless of
                    his allegiance, and Al's neighbor Christina "Chris"
                    Mackenzie, secretly the Gundam test pilot. As Bernie
                    tries to repair his damaged mobile suit while hiding out
                    within the station, he develops a close friendship with
                    Al and slowly becomes infatuated with Chris, both pilots
                    remaining unaware of each other's true natures.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As time passes, Bernie discovers that Zeon will destroy
                    Side 6 with a nuclear weapon if he cannot destroy the
                    prototype Gundam. Feeling that he has no choice if the
                    station is to be saved, Bernie takes his mobile suit and
                    goes to engage the Gundam. Believing Side 6 to be under
                    Zeon attack, Chris is ordered to pilot the Gundam in the
                    station's defense, and she and Bernie engage in a
                    destructive battle within the station. Al discovers that
                    the Zeon ship carrying the nuclear weapons was captured,
                    meaning Bernie has no more reason to fight. Alfred goes
                    to try and stop Bernard, only to see Bernie's mobile
                    suit destroyed and an injured Christina pulled from the
                    heavily damaged Gundam, which leaves Al horrified.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Afterwards, Chris tells Al that she will be leaving Side
                    6, and asks Alfred to say goodbye to Bernard for her,
                    still unaware that she had actually killed him. Al does
                    not have the heart to tell her the truth and agrees to
                    her request. The series closes with Al's school holding
                    an assembly in which the principal talks about the
                    effects of war. Al, remembering his time with Bernie,
                    begins to weep uncontrollably during the speech. Al's
                    friends, misunderstanding his grief, try to reassure him
                    that another "cool" war is bound to happen soon..

                    In the year U.C. 0123, the military arm of Cosmo
                    Babylonia, the Crossbone Vanguard, attacks the Earth
                    Federation colony Frontier IV. Student mechanic Seabook
                    Arno and his friend Cecily Fairchild are caught in the
                    middle of the fighting as the Federation garrison is
                    quickly overwhelmed. Seabook and Cecily lead a group of
                    refugees into the lower levels of the colony, where they
                    meet up with Seabook's father, Leslie. As the group
                    boards a lifeboat, Seabook catches sight of Cecily's
                    father, Theo, attempting to abduct her and tries to
                    intervene. However, the Crossbone Vanguard arrives and
                    takes Cecily, who is actually Berah Ronah, part of the
                    Ronah family who are the leaders behind Cosmo Babylonia.
                    Seabook is forced to retreat to the lifeboat while
                    Leslie stays behind to help a lost child.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Cecily is taken to meet her real father Carozzo and
                    grandfather Meitzer, who both dream of overthrowing the
                    corrupt Earth Federation and replacing it with a more
                    just aristocracy. Cecily is reluctant to join them, but
                    feels she has no choice. Meanwhile, the lifeboat manages
                    to reach the neighboring colony Frontier I, but it is
                    also under attack by the Crossbone Vanguard. Seabook's
                    group then comes across the Space Ark, a Federation
                    training ship carrying the inoperative Gundam F91. Due
                    to the confusion caused by the Crossbone Vanguard's
                    surprise attack, the Space Ark is run by a barely
                    experienced skeleton crew with no available pilots.
                    Pressed into Federation service, Seabook works on
                    repairing the F91 and discovers it was developed by his
                    mother, Monica. The crew is able to repair the F91 just
                    in time to repel an assault by the Crossbone Vanguard,
                    forcing them to retreat.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Seabook then uses the F91 to return to Frontier IV,
                    where Cosmo Babylonia has already repaired most of the
                    damage to the colony and has fully occupied it. He
                    infiltrates the Ronah estate and makes contact with
                    Cecily. However, he is forced to flee without her when
                    the guards pursue him. Leslie helps Seabook escape
                    Frontier IV, but he suffers a mortal head injury in the
                    process and dies on the return trip to Frontier I.
                    Cecily joins the Crossbone Vanguard under Zabine
                    Chareux's command. He helps train Cecily to be a mobile
                    suit pilot and warns her that there are several factions
                    within Cosmo Babylonia working against each others'
                    interests, with one faction working on a secret
                    superweapon codenamed "Bug". Seabook returns to Frontier
                    I, where he is again forced by the Federation to help
                    defend the colony against an impending attack by the
                    Crossbone Vanguard. Instead, Seabook and the crew of the
                    Space Ark secretly decide to desert and flee to the
                    Moon.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Cecily is assigned the advanced Vigna Ghina mobile suit
                    and accompanies the Crossbone Vanguard as they break
                    into Frontier I. After a brief but intense skirmish, the
                    Crossbone Vanguard are once again forced to withdraw.
                    Seabook encounters Cecily in battle and she decides to
                    defect upon discovering her friends are still alive.
                    Carozzo then arrives at Frontier I and deploys the Bugs,
                    automated war machines designed to specifically hunt
                    down humans. He believes that Earth's population must be
                    purged to preserve its environment, and intends to use
                    Frontier I as a testing ground for the Bugs. Seabook and
                    Cecily work together to destroy the Bugs, with Cecily
                    destroying their mothership. Angered, Carozzo deploys in
                    his own mobile armor, the Rafflesia, and battles Seabook
                    and Cecily. The Vigna Ghina is destroyed, ejecting
                    Cecily into space and Seabook destroys the Rafflesia in
                    response. Zabine arrives on the scene, but decides to
                    spare Seabook and the Space Ark due to his disagreement

                    <b>Mobile Fighter G Gundam</b> Tv Series Unlike previous
                    series in the Gundam franchise which are set in the
                    "Universal Century" timeline, Mobile Fighter G Gundam
                    takes place in an alternate "Future Century" universe.
                    Within this timeline, much of mankind has abandoned a
                    ruined Earth to live in space colonies. The countries on
                    Earth have corresponding colonies just outside the
                    planet's atmosphere. Rather than fight wars for
                    political and social dominance, the colonies agree to
                    hold a "Gundam Fight" tournament every four years. Each
                    country sends to Earth a representative piloting a
                    highly advanced, humanoid mobile fighter called a
                    Gundam. The Gundams compete with one another in
                    one-on-one battles, under a strict set of rules, until
                    only one fighter remains; the nation represented by the
                    winner earns the right to rule all of space for that
                    period.Each Gundam is controlled directly by the user
                    within the cockpit using the "Mobile Trace System", a
                    gesture recognition and feedback mechanism whereby the
                    Gundam mimics the pilot's own body motion, combat
                    skills, and weapon-wielding capabilities. G Gundam opens
                    at the start of the 13th Gundam Fight in Future Century
                    year 60 and follows Neo Japan's Domon Kasshu, fighter of
                    his nation's Shining Gundam and bearer of the coveted
                    "King of Hearts" martial arts crest.Aside from winning
                    the tournament, Domon's mission is to track down his
                    fugitive, older brother Kyoji, who allegedly stole the
                    experimental Devil Gundam from Neo Japan's government,
                    leaving their mother dead and their father (Dr. Raizo
                    Kasshu) to be arrested and placed in a cryogenic state

                    Under orders from Major Ullube Ishikawa, Domon and his
                    childhood friend and mechanic Rain Mikamura travel from
                    country to country, challenging each one's Gundam while
                    searching for clues to the whereabouts of Kyoji and the
                    Devil Gundam. Domon's initial matches with Neo America's
                    Chibodee Crocket, Neo France's George DeSand, Neo
                    China's Sai Sai Ci, and Neo Russia's Argo Gulskii end in
                    draws, gaining mutual respect among the fighters. As
                    they encounter Gundam pilots who had come in contact
                    with the Devil Gundam, Domon and Rain learn of its
                    unique cellular properties to regenerate, multiply, and
                    evolve by infecting organic matter and causing violent
                    behavior in living things.The duo then journey to Neo
                    Tokyo, a city decimated by the Devil Gundam's army of
                    mobile weapons. Domon reunites with his esteemed martial
                    arts instructor Master Asia, who is also the champion of
                    the last Gundam Fight, the former King of Hearts, and
                    one-time leader of an elite group of Gundam fighters
                    called the Shuffle Alliance. After Domon and Rain help
                    the city's survivors defend their last outpost in
                    Shinjuku, Master Asia reveals himself as a servant of
                    the Devil Gundam, having also gained control over
                    Chibodee, George, Sai Sai Ci, and Argo using Devil
                    Gundam (DG) cells. The four remaining members of the
                    Shuffle Alliance intervene and vow to destroy their
                    previous leader for his crimes. Ultimately, the Alliance
                    members offer their lives in purging the DG cells from
                    Domon's four comrades and bestow each of them with a
                    Shuffle Alliance crest as their successors. Kyoji and
                    the enormous Devil Gundam eventually appear from beneath
                    the ground of Shinjuku but shortly thereafter vanish
                    alongside Master Asia. As the Shuffle Alliance trains in
                    the Guiana Highlands for the Gundam Fight finals, Master
                    Asia and the Devil Gundam reappear. With the help of his
                    friends and a new ally in Neo Germany's masked warrior
                    Schwarz Bruder, Domon defeats the Devil Gundam. When the
                    Shining Gundam becomes incapacitated during the battle,
                    Domon desperately manages to activate a newly acquired
                    God Gundam, escape Master Asia, and make his way to the
                    finals set in Neo Hong Kong.

                <p>
                    The Gundam Fight finals are presided over by Wong
                    Yunfat, Neo Hong Kong's prime minister, and the current
                    ruler of the space colonies and Earth. Wong chooses to
                    have the qualifying nations battle in one-on-one and tag
                    team preliminary matches to reach a battle royale on
                    Lantau Island, where the tournament is to end with the
                    winner facing the defending champion Master Asia. Having
                    gained possession of the Devil Gundam, Wong secretly
                    plots to revive and control it as his trump card to
                    inevitably maintain his own power over space. Domon and
                    his companions make their way to the battle royale while
                    several truths concerning the Devil Gundam are unveiled.
                    Rain's father, Dr. Mikamura, eventually explains that
                    the Devil Gundam (originally called the Ultimate Gundam)
                    was constructed by Dr. Kasshu to rejuvenate the dying
                    Earth. Jealous of his genius colleague, Dr. Mikamura had
                    Neo Japan's officials attempt to confiscate Kasshu's
                    creation. To prevent the military from using his
                    father's invention for its own agenda, Kyoji fled with
                    and crash-landed the Gundam on Earth, where its computer
                    malfunctioned, triggering its malevolent activity.
                    Ullube subsequently had Dr. Kasshu arrested, framed
                    Kyoji as a criminal, and used Domon and Rain as pawns in
                    recovering the Gundam. In a separate confession, Master
                    Asia discloses to Domon that, having been distressed by
                    the utter destruction wrought by the Gundam Fights, he
                    planned to use the Devil Gundam to wipe out humanity and
                    allow Earth to heal naturally. The battle on Lantau
                    Island culminates with Domon fatally besting Master Asia
                    in a final confrontation, while Kyoji and Schwarz
                    sacrifice themselves so that Domon can attack the Devil
                    Gundam's cockpit and disable it once again. Though the
                    schemes of both Wong and Master Asia are foiled, Ullube
                    quietly claims the Devil Gundam and transports it to Neo
                    Japan's space colony for his own purpose. Having been
                    corrupted by DG cells with ambitions of supreme power,
                    Ullube kidnaps Rain and places her into the Devil
                    Gundam's core to act as its energy source. The hulking
                    monstrosity then merges with the colony and begins
                    absorbing Earth itself. As the entire world's Gundams
                    unite to assault the Devil Gundam from the outside, the
                    Shuffle Alliance breaks inside the colony and destroys
                    Ullube. Finally, Domon professes his love for Rain and
                    releases her from the core. Invoking the power of the
                    King of Hearts, the couple vanquishes the Devil Gundam
                    once and for all.

                    and trained by each of the five scientists, then sent to
                    Earth independently in extremely advanced mobile suits
                    (one designed by each of the scientists) known as
                    "Gundams" (called such because they are constructed from
                    a rare and astonishingly durable material called
                    Gundanium alloy, which can only be created in outer
                    space). Each Gundam is sent from a different colony, and

                    Episiode The series is set in Universal Century 0079 in
                    the jungles of Southeast Asia. The Earth Federation and
                    the Principality of Zeon are fighting a brutal guerrilla
                    war for control of the area and its resources. Zeon's
                    best hope for victory in the region rests with an
                    experimental mobile armor and its pilot, Aina Sahalin.
                    Meanwhile, the Earth Federation Army receive
                    reinforcements in the form of Ensign Shiro Amada, newly
                    named commander of the 08th MS Team. Aina and Shiro know
                    each other from a mutual rescue in space, but when Shiro
                    discovers that Aina is in fact the pilot of the Zeon
                    mobile armor he is arrested for treason.

                    The Federation offers Shiro one chance at redemption: he
                    must take the 08th MS Team deep into Zeon held territory
                    to find Zeon's hidden base. With the Zeon backed into a
                    corner, and the Federation dependent on Shiro and his
                    team for victory, the star crossed lovers must decide

                    battles between Earth and the space colonies have ended.
                    Treize Khushrenada is dead and OZ has come to an end.
                    This gives birth to the Earth Sphere Unified Nation
                    (ESUN) and the Preventers. Seeing they won't be needed
                    anymore, the Gundam pilots (except Chang Wufei) send
                    their suits into the sun. However, this peace would not
                    last, for a rebellion occurs on the newly completed
                    colony, L3 X-18999. Led by seven-year-old Mariemaia
                    Khushrenada, Treize's illegitimate daughter, the
                    rebellion kidnaps Relena Darlian, now the Vice Foreign
                    Minister of the ESUN, during a diplomatic mission to
                    X-18999. As the Gundam pilots investigate further, they
                    discover that Mariemaia is merely a puppet controlled by
                    her grandfather Dekim Barton, a former advisor to
                    martyred colony leader Heero Yuy, who is using X-18999
                    to go through with the original Operation Meteor, as a
                    contingency plan in case the ESUN doesn't comply. The
                    Gundam pilots must prevent Dekim from seizing power over
                    the ESUN. The Gundams are retrieved from their course to
                    sun to Earth's orbit thanks to Quatre and the Maganacs.
                    The pilots use their Gundams one last time to fight
                    against Dekim's forces, not killing anyone. In the end,
                    Dekim is killed by one of his own soldiers, Earth and

                    reconnaissance mission to determine whether the Earth
                    was fit for resettlement, Loran lands on the continent

                    He's taken by surprise when the Moonrace intends to
                    return to Earth via an offensive with mobile suits, and

                    The night of the first attack, Loran is at the White
                    Doll, an enormous humanoid statue, for a coming-of-age
                    ceremony. When the Moonrace attacks and the battle in
                    town can be seen from a distance the children panic. In
                    the midst of this panic, the White Doll shatters,
                    revealing a metallic figure within, and the shrine
                    collapses around it. During the panic, Loran recognizes
                    the White Doll as a mobile suit, and succeeds in
                    applying his knowledge of the Moonrace's mobile suits to
                    pilot it. The death of the Heim patriarch in the attack
                    pulls the family and Loran into the budding war; Loran
                    becomes the designated pilot of the White Doll, and its
                    discovery prompts the excavation of further mobile suits
                    in the various "mountain cycles" covering the Earth. As
                    the Moonrace's invasion rapidly turns into a
                    full-fledged war against the increasingly armed
                    Earthrace, it becomes clear that this state of affairs
                    is divisive among both groups; while the Moonrace's
                    queen Dianna Soreil attempts to negotiate with the local
                    leaders for a peaceful solution by which the Moonrace
                    can come to reside on the Earth, the militaristic among
                    both populations interfere with the negotiations again
                    and again, forcing the war to continue as opposed to
                    accepting a compromise.

                    after the lieutenant is saved, the lab is commandeered
                    by the Congressional Armed Forces, led by Mark's former
                    superior, Jack Halle. As the facility's security system
                    is triggered, Mark goes off to investigate. Mark saves
                    one of the intruders, Cynthia Graves, from Jack's firing

                    The CONSENT is in the midst of a global food shortage,
                    with its military leaders threatening force to take over
                    the neutral Side 8 Settlement of Gaea. General Garneuax
                    asks Mark to interrogate Cynthia, who is revealed to be
                    a Gaean rebel. Mark helps Cynthia escape, who shows him
                    an enzyme that allows food to grow underwater, which can
                    solve the food shortage. The two meet up with Cynthia's

                    into space along with Mark's fiancée Mimi Devere.
                    Meanwhile, Jack frames Mark for the murder of a CONSENT
                    soldier, whom Jack had killed himself. The group arrives
                    at the Side 4 Settlement of New Manhattan, meeting with
                    Philippe San Simeone, an old acquaintance of Mark, and a
                    member of the Illuminati, a private paramilitary
                    organization. Philippe entrusts Mark with a new

                    that a Congressional Armed Forces fleet is on its way to
                    Gaea, looking to apprehend the two and the enzyme

                    hacks into Gaea's defense system, causing debris
                    clearing guns to fire at a CONSENT ship. After Mark
                    concludes that a mobile suit carrier is on its way to
                    attack Gaea, Cynthia asks Mark to lead Gaea's mobile
                    suit force against the approaching CONSENT forces. Both
                    sides launch their mobile suit forces, with CONSENT
                    greatly outmatching Gaea's obsolete RGM-196 Freedom

                    critically wounded while trying to protect the enzyme
                    sample. After retrieving the sample, Garneuax reveals
                    his true intentions to destroy the sample and implement
                    a policy of selective starvation across the CONSENT.

                    Illuminati's forces arrive and push back the CONSENT
                    attack. Jack is defeated by Mark and the G-Saviour, who

                    The series is the first of the Gundam franchise set in
                    the "Cosmic Era" in which humankind is divided between
                    normal Earth dwelling humans, known as "Naturals", and
                    the genetically altered super-humans known as
                    "Coordinators". The primary conflict of the story plot
                    derives from jealous hatred by Naturals of the abilities
                    of Coordinators, leading to hate crimes, and eventually
                    the emigration of almost all Coordinators who flee into
                    space to live idyllic lives on giant orbital space
                    colonies called PLANTS of their own design. War
                    eventually breaks out between Earth and the PLANTS. The
                    Earth is divided between two major factions, the Earth
                    Forces formed from most of the natural born human
                    nations, primarily the Eurasians and the Atlantic
                    Federation, and a natural human supremacist group known
                    as Blue Cosmos with its slogan, "For the preservation of
                    our blue and pure world". The Earth Forces are not a
                    unified alliance, and infighting and mistrust exist
                    between their various nation states. The second major
                    Earth nation is the Orb Union, a staunchly politically
                    neutral and isolationist nation located on small Pacific
                    Ocean islands ruled by a hereditary monarchy and still
                    contains Coordinator citizens.

                    Two major events precede the story, known as the Bloody
                    Valentine tragedy that initiated war between the PLANTS
                    and the Earth Forces when one of the PLANT space
                    stations, Junius-7, is destroyed by a nuclear bomb. The
                    second event is the counterattack by the PLANTS that
                    buries Neutron Jammers deep into Earth's crust that
                    halts all nuclear reactions and long range radar and
                    radio, causing most areas of earth to go without
                    electricity or communication, and requiring mobile suits
                    to rely on rechargeable batteries.

                    The PLANTS are a technological power house, developing
                    many new technologies that give them equal power to
                    Earth despite their very small population. It is the

                    neutral Orb Union military. Additionally, Heliopolis
                    constructs a unique carrier battleship, the Archangel,
                    to base the five mobile suits from for the Earth Forces.
                    The colony is attacked by ZAFT forces, the military of
                    the PLANTS, with the objective of stealing the new
                    units. During the incursion an Orb Union student and
                    Coordinator named Kira Yamato, upon seeing his friends
                    in danger, pilots the GAT-X105 Strike mobile suit to
                    fend off the invaders but the colony is critically
                    damaged in the ensuing fight. As Heliopolis
                    disintegrates, the survivors board the Archangel, and
                    begin their journey to the Alliance base in Alaska.
                    During the journey to Earth, Kira pilots the Strike to
                    counter a series of attacks by ZAFT but is seemingly
                    killed by his childhood friend, ZAFT soldier Athrun
                    Zala, during one of their battles in which he also is
                    nearly killed. Kira survives the attack and is taken by
                    a blind priest to one of the PLANT space colonies, home
                    to the Coordinators to recover. The Archangel arrives in
                    Alaska but ZAFT launches a full-scale attack on the base
                    overpowering their enemies. Unknown to ZAFT, the Earth
                    forces knew of this attack ahead of time. They planned
                    to sacrifice the Alaska base along with the Archangel in
                    order to destroy ZAFT's army using a weapon of mass
                    destruction hidden underneath the Alaska base.

                    Kira goes to Alaska with the ZGMF-X10A Freedom, a highly
                    advanced, nuclear powered, and Neutron Jammer proof ZAFT
                    mobile suit stolen by the PLANT pop star Coordinator
                    Lacus Clyne, daughter of PLANT Supreme Council Chairman
                    Siegel Clyne. Using the Freedom, Kira is able to help
                    the Archangel flee the destruction of the Alaska base.
                    The Archangel flees to the neutral country of the Orb
                    Union. The Archangel and a new ship, the Orb Union ship
                    Kusanagi leave Earth for space where they then join
                    Lacus Clyne's rebel faction and their stolen ZAFT
                    battleship, the Eternal (meant to carry the Freedom and
                    Justice mobile suits) to form the Three Ships Alliance
                    with the common goal of ending the war between the
                    Naturals and Coordinators. In the midst of the conflict,
                    Athrun learns that Kira survived and searches for him
                    under orders to recover the Freedom Gundam, and is given
                    an equally powerful prototype, the ZGMF-X09A Justice.
                    However, after learning of Patrick Zala's, Athrun's
                    father and the radical militant faction leader of the
                    PLANT Supreme Council, plan to commit genocide, Athrun
                    deserts him and joins the Three Ships Alliance. In a
                    final battle, the Earth Forces deploys nuclear weapons
                    equipped with Neutron Jammer Canceler technology copied
                    from stolen data on the Freedom and Justice Gundam's
                    power systems. The Earth Forces intend to destroy the
                    PLANT space colonies but are stopped by ZAFT's GENESIS,
                    a super weapon microwave laser designed to commit
                    genocide on the Naturals. The Three Ship Alliance
                    intervenes to defeat the GENESIS weapon ending the
                    battle. The war ultimately ends as a peace treaty is
                    signed.

                    season the plot for the first season is set 2307 AD. As
                    a result of the depletion of fossil fuels, humanity had
                    to search for a new source of power. The power was found
                    in the form of multiple Dyson rings (massive arrays of
                    solar power collectors) orbiting Earth, and supported by
                    three orbital elevators, each one serving one of the
                    three "power blocs" on the planet, namely the Union
                    (Union of Solar Energy and Free Nations), controlling
                    the Americas, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan; the
                    Human Reform League , controlling nearly all of mainland
                    Asia besides the Middle East along with most of Oceania;
                    and the AEU (Advanced European Union), which controls
                    mainland Europe as well as many islands in the North
                    Atlantic and Arctic Oceans. With this nearly
                    inexhaustible source of energy benefiting only the major
                    powers and their allies, constant warfare erupts around
                    the globe among minor countries for fuels and energy.
                    Countries that once economically relied on the sale of
                    fossil fuels have plunged into poverty. Some even
                    believe that solar energy threatened the "promised land
                    of God", resulting in the 20-year Solar Wars. This chaos
                    led to the formation of a private military organization,
                    called Celestial Being (ソレスタルビーイング, Soresutaru
                    Bīingu), dedicated to eradicating war and uniting
                    humanity through the use of four advanced machines
                    called Gundams.Mobile Suit Gundam 00 follows four mobile
                    suit pilots termed Gundam Meisters (ガンダムマイスター,
                    Gandamu Maisutā), sided with Celestial Being. The main
                    protagonist is 16-year-old Setsuna F. Seiei, a taciturn
                    Gundam pilot who grew up in the war-torn Middle Eastern
                    Republic of Krugis (which seems to be based on the

                    Nations Army in order to counter Celestial Being's armed
                    interventions. In order to fight the Gundams, the United
                    Nations Army employed the help of Laguna Harvey. Harvey,
                    a Celestial Being intelligence agent turned traitor,
                    provides them with 30 GN-X, mobile suits equipped with
                    pseudo-GN Drives. As the United Nations resist Celestial
                    Being's interventions, a second team of Gundams, known

                    the 00 Gundam – which is entrusted to Setsuna. To pilot
                    the two remaining new units, Lockon Stratos' twin
                    brother is invited to assume his brother's codename and
                    former position as the pilot of the Cherudim Gundam, and
                    after Allelujah Haptism is rescued from the prison he
                    was being detained in during the timeskip, he assumes
                    the command of Arios Gundam. Saji Crossroad reluctantly
                    joins Setsuna to pilot the upgraded 00 Raiser and
                    confront his girlfriend Louise Halevy who has joined the
                    A-Laws.

                    Unknown to Celestial Being and the A-Laws, a third party
                    is manipulating both sides of the conflict. This group
                    call themselves "Innovators", composed of Alejandro
                    Corner's former assistant Ribbons Almark, and his six
                    subordinates. Subsequently, it is revealed that Aeolia
                    Schenberg's plan is to ensure humanity's survival; unite
                    the world's factions through Celestial Being's armed
                    interventions and then advance humanity into deep space
                    and undergo Innovation, a trans-human process.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After uncovering the truth about Ribbons' true
                    intentions, Celestial Being joins forces with dissident
                    members of the A-Laws to stop their oppression and bring
                    the fight to the Innovades. Having been continuously
                    exposed to the GN particles of the fully completed
                    Gundam 00, Setsuna undergoes Innovation, becoming the
                    first true Innovator with powers far greater than
                    Ribbons and his group. The conflict ends in a final
                    showdown between Ribbons and Setsuna with the latter
                    emerging victorious. Following the final battle, the
                    Federation disbands the A-Laws and works towards a
                    genuine global peace while Celestial Being returns into
                    the shadows until another intervention is needed.

                    Meanwhile, the Earth Sphere Federation has found the
                    research station heading towards earth and sends out
                    GN-XIV's, led by Andrei Smirnov, to destroy it. Kati
                    Mannequin arrived on board the Celestial Being station
                    with Patrick Colasour and encounter Veda along with its
                    surviving Innovades, now serving the Federation to
                    maintain the mothership. They later meet the newest
                    emerging Innovator, Captain Descartes Shaman. When the
                    probe ship is still heading towards Earth despite being
                    hit by GN missiles, Descartes heads out and pilots the

                    with debris falling to Earth. Soon after, Earth
                    experiences strange events, with electronic vehicles and
                    devices operating on their own. A young girl Amia Lee

                    whose body has been partially assimilated with a new
                    metal. They hypothesize that the events occurring are
                    related to the alien metal lifeform, now dubbed the
                    Extraterrestrial Living-metal Shape-shifters (ELS).
                    During this time, Setsuna and Louise's quantum
                    brainwaves give them ominous feelings about upcoming
                    events. Setsuna's concern magnifies when the Ptolemaios

                    He is about to touch Louise when Setsuna appears and
                    shoots the man's visor, revealing him to be the same
                    type of Innovade as Ribbons Almark. The attacker is only
                    stopped with a plastic explosive. In Mongolia, a

                    The same Jupiter research station that had been
                    destroyed reappears and the Celestial Being forces moves
                    to intercept it. Setsuna heads out in the 00 Raiser
                    Condenser Type, along with Lockon in his new Gundam, the
                    Zabanya, and Allelujah, paired with Marie in the Gundam
                    Harute, confront the ELS. Problems began to arise when
                    Setsuna is unable to fight the ELS due to quantum
                    brainwave interference. The 00 Raiser begins to undergo
                    assimilation, however Tieria Erde arrives in the Raphael
                    Gundam and rips out 00 Raiser's infected left arm,
                    allowing Setsuna and the team to escape. Unknown to both
                    the Federation and Ptolemaios crew, the ELS had begun
                    launching its forces from Jupiter's Big Red Spot,
                    sucking in Io and Ganymede.

                    The Federation forces later travel to Mars in order to
                    discover the ELS's intentions, with Descartes heading
                    out first in the Gadelaza. However most of its ships and
                    Mobile suits were assimilated, and Descartes ends up
                    being assimilated as well, killing him in the process.
                    Celestial Being arrives too late to save the Federation
                    soldiers and engages in battle against the ELS. Setsuna
                    executes Trans-Am Burst in an attempt to communicate
                    with the ELS, theorizing that this is the "dialogues to
                    come" that Aeolia Schenberg was conditioning humanity
                    for. Unfortunately, Setsuna falls victim to a mental
                    attack from the ELS and is rendered comatose in the
                    middle of battle. Tieria reveals Raphael Gundam's
                    backpack, GN-008RE Seravee Gundam II, and rips 00
                    Raiser's cockpit from the frame, handing it to Lockon as
                    Tieria tries to hold off the ELS with his quantum
                    brainwaves. With the ELS surrounding him, Tieria
                    self-destructs his Gundam to take out ELS with him. The
                    Sol Brave Squadron, led by Graham Aker, arrive and help
                    Celestial Being escape. Tieria's conscious mind returns
                    to Veda and Feldt Grace desperately awaits at Setsuna's
                    side to awaken. After the battle, the Ptolemaios crew
                    and the Earth Sphere Federation witness the appearance
                    of a large moon-size ELS, determining that it will
                    arrive at Earth in 92 days.

                    With most of the civilians being informed of the
                    situation and heading towards shelters, Saji tells
                    Louise that he's going to the Orbital Elevator to help
                    fight the ELS as the last line of defense. On the day of
                    the ELS's arrival, the Federation Fleet gathered
                    alongside Forces from the Federation Members and launch
                    a counterattack against the ELS with a missile barrage,
                    which is rendered futile by the ELS' adapting. Kati, in
                    charge of the operation, orders to fire the ship's main
                    cannon, which damages the ELS superstructure. During
                    this time, Tieria requests that Ian Vashti install a
                    miniature Veda terminal in the cockpit of 00 Qan[T] to
                    handle the massive amounts of information that would
                    result from linking with the ELS again.

                    The battle begins, many of the Federation's Baikal-class
                    ships are assimilated by the ELS, who subsequently
                    created their own copies of the technology. Zabanya and
                    Harute arrive to assist the ESF and member forces in
                    battle. Despite the much needed backup, the ELS still
                    overwhelms the allied forces and assimilates many ships
                    and Mobile Suits. Andrei Smirnov notices one of the ELS
                    ships heading straight for Earth and self-destructs his
                    GNX to destroy the ELS ship at the cost of his life.
                    Meanwhile, on board the Ptolemaios 2, a still-comatose
                    Setsuna lies in a dream-like state. There, he has
                    visions of the first Lockon, Christina Sierra, and
                    Lichtendahl Tsery. Setsuna then sees the flower that
                    Feldt gave him and finally wakes up with Feldt at his
                    side. He sorties in the GNT-0000 00 Qan[T] for battle,
                    while Feldt returns to the bridge.

                    In battle, Patrick's GN-XIV is hit by an ELS and is
                    slowly assimilated. He prepares to self-destruct before
                    saying goodbyes to Kati, when Setsuna blasts Patrick's
                    GNX, saving him from assimilation. With a large number
                    of ELS appearing, the Harute is eventually assimilated
                    and Allelujah and Marie are forced to eject. Setsuna
                    attempts to communicate with the ELS via the Twin
                    Drive’s quantum effect, but it is to no avail as the ELS
                    constantly thwart Setsuna's attempts. Tieria, now a
                    small hologram inside of the 00 Qan[T], tells Setsuna
                    that Trans-Am is necessary for the dialogues. Graham
                    Aker, now partially assimilated, decides to believe in a
                    better future for humanity and sacrifices himself to
                    create a large hole using Trans-Am, allowing Setsuna to
                    enter the core of the ELS ship. The Battle begins to
                    transform into a massacre with swarms of ELS even
                    attacking the orbital elevator where Saji is working at.
                    After Setsuna establishes contact, he realizes the
                    attack was a misunderstanding as assimilation was their
                    only means to understand humanity. It also revealed that
                    the ELS's original homeworld had been consumed by a red
                    giant star and they began searching the universe for a
                    new home. Along the way they reformed various planets
                    and eventually found a new home, eventually setting out
                    into the vast reaches of space to explore the universe.
                    Through Setsuna's quantum brainwaves, the true intention
                    of the ELS's arrival to Earth was understood, and the
                    battle was halted. Setsuna becomes humanity's liaison
                    and uses the 00 Qan[T] to quantize to the ELS homeworld.
                    The ELS then uses Setsuna's vision of a flower to alter
                    the superstructure of their mother ship, ending the
                    battle.

                    In a flashback, a much younger Aeolia Schenberg is shown
                    speaking with E. A. Ray (the human base for Ribbons
                    Almark) of his plan, and comments that humanity must
                    unite if they hope to have any chance of reaching the
                    future. Fifty years later, the flower in space is now a
                    deep space station for intergalactic travel, with the
                    ELS now co-existing with humanity. A ship named after
                    Sumeragi is being prepared for travel, being crewed by
                    Innovators. As a news correspondent is talking on

                    Kudelia Aina Bernstein, a Martian noblewoman, employs
                    the civilian security company Chryse Guard Security
                    (CGS) to transport her to Earth to negotiate the
                    independence of her nation, Chryse, from Earth. But the
                    Earth Military organization Gjallarhorn, attacks CGS in
                    an attempt to halt the Martian independence movement.
                    During the attack, Orga Itsuka, the leader of the Third
                    Army Division within CGS, which is composed of children,
                    decides to rebel against the adult higher-ups who had
                    escaped and left the child and teen foot-soldiers to
                    fight and die as disposable decoys. As all hope seems
                    lost, a young orphan under Orga's command named Mikazuki
                    Augus enters the battle, piloting a hastily repaired
                    mobile suit: the legendary Gundam Barbatos. After
                    repelling Gjallarhorn's attack, Orga and the rest of the
                    Third Army Division dispose of the adult higher-ups who
                    betrayed them and take control of CGS, refounding it as
                    the mercenary company "Tekkadan" (Japanese for "Iron

                    to Earth for her to take part in the negotiations with
                    the government of Arbrau, the superpower that rules over
                    Chryse. However, Gjallarhorn's continuous attempts to
                    stop their progress leads Tekkadan to join forces with
                    Teiwaz, a business conglomerate that operates around
                    Jupiter. Under Teiwaz's protection and being secretly
                    assisted by McGillis Fareed, one of the top echelons of
                    Gjallarhorn with his own agenda, Tekkadan successfully
                    takes Kudelia to Earth, and safely escorts her to
                    Arbrau's capital where she successfully negotiates more

                    mining company in Chryse, working to improve the
                    inhabitants' conditions and McGillis moves forward with
                    his agenda to reform Gjallarhorn. However, one of
                    Gjallarhorn's factions opposing him, the Arianrhod
                    Fleet, led by Rustal Elion, starts working in the
                    shadows to sabotage both McGillis and Tekkadan. McGillis
                    convinces Tekkadan to help him destroy Arianrhod under
                    the promise that once he manages to take full control of
                    Gjallarhorn, he will transfer all authority over Mars to
                    Tekkadan, making them the de facto rulers of the planet.
                    However, they are defeated and forced to flee to Mars,
                    where McGillis is killed after a last, failed attempt to
                    kill Rustal and Tekkadan is disbanded after Arianrhod
                    launches an attack to exterminate all members and make
                    an example out of them, but only a few, including

                    repeals its council system and reforms into a more
                    democratic organization, with Rustal as its head.

                    Both the Unicorn Gundam and the Banshee were supposedly
                    dismantled. With the original draft of the Universal
                    Century Charter revealed, the existence of Newtypes and
                    their promised rights have become known to the public.
                    One year later, in U.C.0097, the world is largely
                    unchanged despite these revelations. The reappearance of
                    the RX-0 Gundam unit 3 Phenex, "brother" to the Unicorn
                    and Banshee, two years after it disappeared triggers the
                    Federation to launch Operation "Phoenix Hunt" to capture
                    the mobile suit. Minister Monaghan Bakharov of the
                    Republic of Zeon secretly directs a Zeon unit to the
                    same objective through his operative Erica Yugo. Mineva
                    Lao Zabi, the figurehead "princess" of Zeon, calls out
                    Monaghan's ambitions, though she cannot directly
                    intervene.

                    The powerful corporation Luio & Co. assigns Michele Luio
                    and pilot Jona Basta along with the RX-9 Narrative
                    Gundam to assist the Federation. Michele and Jona's
                    childhood friend, Rita Bernal, is believed to be in
                    control of the Phenex. Rita, Michele, and Jona were
                    declared the "Miracle Children" after predicting the
                    colony drop from Zeon's "Operation British" at the
                    opening of the One Year War, saving many lives. Michele
                    and Jona know that only Rita displayed true Newtype
                    precognition. The Federation and Zeon teams detect the
                    Phenex within a college colony at Side 6. The two sides
                    race to the scene, though the Phenex is nowhere to be
                    found. Piloting a Sinanju Stein, Zeon pilot Zoltan
                    Akkanen, a failed product of the project that created
                    Full Frontal, attacks Jona and the Narrative Gundam and
                    inflicts serious damage to the colony. Zoltan summons
                    the II Neo Zeong mobile armor to help him destroy Jona,
                    and the massive armor breaches the hull of colony. The
                    conflict ends after the Phenex finally appears and
                    disrupts the encounter before escaping.

                    In the aftermath of the disastrous events within the
                    colony, Minister Monaghan instructs Erica to flee her
                    ship as he intends to blame the event on rogue Sleeves
                    remnants and have the Federation destroy the rest of the
                    force. Zoltan overhears the communication and murders
                    Erica. He suffers a psychotic break and launches in the
                    II Neo Zeong with no greater intent than mass
                    destruction. Michele reveals she orchestrated the
                    encounter in the colony in order to draw out the Phenex.
                    As teenagers, she, Rita, and Jona became victims of the
                    vicious Cyber Newtype experiments surrounding the Gryps
                    Conflict. Michele had arranged for her own adoption by
                    Luio & Co. after tricking Jona into helping her
                    sacrifice Rita to extreme experimentation. She believes
                    she will be absolved of her guilt over Rita when she
                    unlocks the key to immortality within the Phenex - the
                    ability of a psycho-frame to absorb the soul of a dying
                    person, as has happened with the Phenex and Rita, who
                    died after escaping with the Phenex.

                    The Federation fears Zoltan’s assault will cause a rain
                    of debris on Earth even more devastating than Operation
                    British. Jona, Michele, and the Federation forces sortie
                    to defeat Zoltan, joined by the Phenex. The II Neo Zeong
                    proves too powerful and is on the verge of defeating the
                    combined forces. Michele sacrifices herself to protect
                    Jona's heavily damaged Narrative Gundam. Banagher Links
                    arrives in the ARX-014S Silver Bullet Suppressor,
                    intervening to allow Jona to enter the Phenex' empty
                    cockpit. The united souls of Jona, Rita, and Michele
                    drive the Phenex's psycho-frame to contain the
                    destructive power of the II Neo Zeong's own
                    psycho-frame, killing Zoltan and saving the Earth. Jona
                    is released from the Phenex before it speeds away at
                    incredible speed, and is rescued by Banagher, who
                    encourages Jona that the story is not over yet. The RX-0
                    Unicorn Gundam, believed to have been dismantled, is
                    shown to be sealed away by Mineva and Banagher, in case
                    it needs to be called on again.
