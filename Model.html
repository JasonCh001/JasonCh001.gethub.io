                    Gundam models, or Gunpla, are plastic model kits of robots called mobile suits from the Japanese anime franchise, Gundam. They are popular among hobbyists and fans who enjoy assembling and customizing the kits.

                    Following the rise in popularity of the Gundam series in Japan, hundreds of these model kits were released, with Gunpla building becoming a very popular hobby in the country and abroad.</p>

                    Gundam models are highly detailed and include a variety of parts and accessories, such as weapons, shields, and stickers for customization. Some kits also come with LED lights and motorized components for added realism.

                <h2>What Are The Grades Of Gundam Models?</h2>
                <p class="s">In the production of the Gundam models, Bandai uses a system of grading that tells how much detail a model has. Several models are available in different grades, and they depict the same machine in their general appearance. However, the detail of the parts is significantly different. The five most common grades of Gundam models are:</p>
                <!--- I do not know how to add space to a list-->
                <ol class="s">
                    <li> High Grade (HG) - This grade is easy to build, uses many stickers and does not have great detail.<img src="pics/HGModelKit.jpg" alt="High Gread Model Kit" /> </li>

                    <li>Real Grade (RG) - This grade has more pieces and details than HG.<img src="Pics/RGModelKit.jpg" alt="Real Grade Model Kit" /></li>

                    <li>Master Grade (MG) - This grade has more pieces and details, as well as fewer sticker sheets<img src="Pics/MGModelKit.png" alt="Master Grade Model Kit" /> </li>

                    <li>Perfect Grade (PG) -This grade has many different pieces and it is very detailed.<img src="Pics/PGModelKit.png" alt="Perfect Grade Model Kit" /> </li>

                    <li>Super Deformed (SD) -This grade is easy to build similar to Real Grade and Master Grade but on a smaller scale<img src="Pics/SDModelKit.jpg" alt="Super Deformed Model Kit" /> </li>
                </ol>
                <p class="s">When you’re out shopping for a Gundam model kit, these are the four most common grades that you will find, especially if you are visiting a local store that has a limited range of products.
                    The High Grade and Real Grade models are released frequently. The Master Grade models are released just a few times a year, while the Perfect Grade models are released just once a year.
                    As the grades go higher, they become harder to find and more expensive. The High Grade and Real Grade Gundam model kits are highly recommended for beginner builders because they have fewer pieces to put together than the other grades.
